# Shamehub

### Synopsis
Shamehub is a social media platform centered around github commit history and activity. It will be a frontend to backend source of shame...sortof. Users will be able to create accounts and link them to their github. Each activity change or commit will be treated as a status update. Users will be able to add friends giving them the ability to like, dislike, and comment on each status. For each user there will be an overarching “shame timeline”. The Shame Timeline will analyze the users github activity feed and post an appropriate quote summarizing their work. The API’s that will be used are the Github API and the GoodReads API.

## THIS NEEDS REVISIONS THE PLAN HAS CHANGED.

This project works in conjunction with the [ShamehubAPI](https://github.com/TrystanKaes/ShamehubAPI)
